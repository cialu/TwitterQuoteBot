# Twitter Quote Bot
A twitter bot that quotes enough

This is a small php script which can be used to create twitter bots that keep quotes from a web source and tweet them.

I’ve used two files (twitteroauth.php and OAuth.php) of Abraham’s twitteroauth, the most popular PHP library for Twitter's OAuth REST API. 

It works on OAuth, so no password is needed.
